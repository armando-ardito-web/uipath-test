For that, the developer uses an Add Queue Item activity inside an If. What is the correct setting for that activity? Explanation: To set date since when a transaction item should be processed, use Postpone property of Add Queue Item activity.

Rule Exception transactions 3 times. responsible person that the required file is missing. Exception transactions 3 times. Explanation: A Business Exception describes an error rooted in the fact that certain data which the automation project depends on is incomplete or missing. Retrying the transaction does not yield any chance of solving the issue, and there are other better courses of action, such as notifying the human user of this error. By default, Orchestrator does not retry transactions which are failed due to Business Exceptions. This happens because an inconsistency between the transaction value and the business requirement means that there might be errors in the initial data which the queue items were created from.
