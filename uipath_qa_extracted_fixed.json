(Single Select)\nIn this exercise, you will create a UiPath automation that performs the steps below.\nTo achieve this, you will use the REFrameWork as the starting template and follow the UiPath\ndevelopment best practices.\nHere are the steps performed by the Robot:\n2. On the landing page, Dashboard, click on the Work items menu item. Scrape the data in all\nthe pages of the table, page by page, ensuring error handling and recovery.\n3. For each page:\n- Filter the records where Status is ''Open'';\n- Filter the records where Type is ''WI5'';\n- Filter the records where WIID is less than 500000;\n- Append the resulting datatable into an Excel worksheet; you shouldn''t worry about the headers\nand   format of the output file.\nConstraints to follow in the development, using the REFrameWork:\n1. TransactionItem datatype should be a String. The process should recover and retry in case of\nerrors in navigation between WorkItems page. One transaction is the action of scraping one web\n4 Dispatcher from the UiPath Academy).\n2. Create a separate workflow file for the Login to ACME. File input arguments: URL ; Username\n; Password .\n3. Create a separate workflow file for closing ACME.\n3. Add the ACME_URL and ACME_Credential to the Config file.\n4. Populate InitAllApplications.xaml from the Framework folder with Invoking the Login to ACME\nand navigation to the Work Items.\n5. Populate CloseAllApplications.xaml from the Framework folder with Invoking the Close\nACME.\n6. Populate KillAllProcesses.xaml from the Framework folder with killing the process used.\n7. Populate the Process.xaml file with the following actions: Web scraping, Filtering and\nAppending to Excel.\nImportant Note: Don''t use external file references outside of the project folder (including\n\nOrchestrator Assets). Place all the used files within the project folder, zip that folder and upload\nit to the UiPath Certification Platform.\nZip ALL the used workflow files AND the output Excel file. Then upload the .zip file to the UiPath\nCertification Platform.\nGood luck!\nOptions are :\nALL THE BEST!\nA:  Sendusyourfeedbackonthis\nCorrect Answer: A\nQuestion 202.
